# tnseq_function
Association between sequence homology and functional similarity

### code
This directory contains scripts for processing the datatables from JGI and output by panx

### fitness_tables
This directory contains JGI generated datasets on the tnseq fitness values in different host species and environments. When conducting experiments, JGI gave each selection experiment a set number. In each fitness dataset, a condition is referred to both by its set number and a short description of the condition. This description is not detailed, however. The full description can be found in the file all_conditions.txt.
